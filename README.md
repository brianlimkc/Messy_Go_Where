  <h3> Ratings of Users of App, point and reward system </h3> <br/>
     The voucher redemption function of this app is built to encourage users to use this app.<br/>
     Firstly, to get vouchers, we will have to seek out relevant companies who are also concern with the available issue category.<br/>
     Once we have vouchers ready, we are prepared for the release of points when a reported issue has been resolved. <br/>
     This means staffs are able to give points once issue is resolved. The staffs are also able to earns depending on the rating that was given to them   by the users.<br/>
